%description
dbus-sharp is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as
"managed D-Bus" to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap
libdbus). This is the GLib integration for ndesk-dbus.

D-Bus is an inter-process communication framework that lets
applications interface with the system event bus as well as allowing
them to talk to one another in a peer-to-peer configuration.
